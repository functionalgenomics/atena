\title{Pre-defined overlapping mode functions}
\usage{
ovUnion(reads, features, ignoreStrand, minOverlFract)

ovIntersectionStrict(reads, features, ignoreStrand, minOverlFract)
}
\arguments{
\item{reads}{A \code{GAlignments}, \code{GAlignmentList} or a
\code{GAlignmentPairs} object.}

\item{features}{A \code{GRanges} object with annotated features.}

\item{ignoreStrand}{(Default FALSE) A logical which defines if the strand
should be taken into consideration when computing the overlap between reads
and annotated features. When \code{ignoreStrand = FALSE}, an aligned read
will be considered to be overlapping an annotated feature as long as they
have a non-empty intersecting genomic ranges on the same strand, while when
\code{ignoreStrand = TRUE} the strand will not be considered.}

\item{minOverlFract}{(Default 0.2) A numeric scalar. \code{minOverlFract}
is multiplied by the median read length and the resulting value is used to
specify the \code{minoverlap} argument from
\code{\link[IRanges:findOverlaps-methods]{findOverlaps}} from the
\pkg{IRanges} package. When no minimum overlap is required, set
\code{minOverlFract = 0}.}
}
\value{
A \code{Hits} object; see the \code{\link[S4Vectors]{Hits-class}}
manual page.
}
\description{
The following functions control the way in which overlaps between
aligned reads and annotated features are resolved when an aligned
read overlaps more than one feature on the same locus:
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item \code{ovUnion()}: (default)
  \item \code{ovIntersectionStrict()}:
  \item User supplied: a function taking the same parameters as the
        previous three functions and returning a
        \code{\link[S4Vectors]{Hits}} object.
}

They take the following parameters:

These functions are given to the \code{mode} parameter of the
\code{\link{qtex}()} function and are similar to the functions
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments]{Union}()} and
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments]{IntersectionStrict}()} from the
\code{GenomicAlignments} package, with the difference that instead
of returning counts of reads overlapping annotated features, they
return the actual overlaps, because the counting is deferred to other
algorithms that follow some specific strategy when a read maps to
more than one feature. For this same reason, these functions lack
the \code{inter.feature} argument found in the corresponding functions
from the \code{GenomicAlignments} package.
